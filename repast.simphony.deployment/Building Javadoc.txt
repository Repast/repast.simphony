Building Repast Javadoc

1. Run the Ant javadoc.xml using the Eclipse launch.  
     
   	- Update the javadoc title in javadoc.xml
   	- Check the link href to online Java API in javadoc.xml
   	- Make sure that links to Java base classes work in the generated javadoc.

2. Run the buildGroovydocs ant script in r.s.relogo.runtime as described in the
    r.s.relogo.runtime/docs/Readme.txt Step 1.  
    
    - Groovydocs requires downloading a full Groovy SDK binary distribution. 
      This SDK is simply an archive with groovy jars that can be stored in some
      convienient system location, eg /libs.
      
    - The buildGroovyDocs.xml launch configuration Classpath settings must be
      updated to reflect the location of the unpacked groovy /libs folder.  
      These will be the "groovy-...jar" files and one or two of the other jars
      in the groovy /lib folder (see existing launch config).
      
        * Requires building with Groovy 2.5.x SDK since the generated doc HTML
        with version 3.x isn't compatible with the ReLogoReferenceCreator that 
        creates the RelogoPrimiatves.html.
      
    - The buildGroovyDocs.xml launch configuration JRE settings should be 
       "Separate JRE" not "Run in same JRE as workspace" since using the later
       causes issues (on Windows) even though they are the same JRE!
    
    - The version number in buildGroovyDocs.xml should be updated.
    

3.  Merge the results of the Groovydoc as described in the 
    r.s.relogo.runtime/docs/Readme.txt
