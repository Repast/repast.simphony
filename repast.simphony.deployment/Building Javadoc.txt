Building Repast Javadoc

1. Run the Ant javadoc.xml.  You may need to modify or create a launch config
   that provides the javadoc executable if not on the system path.
   
   	- Update the javadoc title in javadoc.xml
   	- Check the link href to online Java API in javadoc.xml
   	- Make sure that links to Java base classes work in the generated javadoc.

2. Run the buildGroovydocs ant script in r.s.relogo.runtime as described in the
    r.s.relogo.runtime/docs/Readme.txt Step 1.  
    
    - Groovydocs requires downloading a full Groovy SDK binary distribution. 
      This SDK is simply an archive with groovy jars that can be stored in some
      convienient system location, eg /libs.
      
    - The buildGroovyDocs.xml launch configuration Classpath settings must be
      updated to reflect the location of the unpacked groovy /libs folder.  
      These will be the "groovy-...jar" files and one or two of the other jars
      in the groovy /lib folder (see existing launch config).
      
    - The buildGroovyDocs.xml launch configuration JRE settings should be 
       "Separate JRE" not "Run in same JRE as workspace" since using the later
       causes issues (on Windows) even though they are the same JRE!
    
    - The version number in buildGroovyDocs.xml should be updated.
    
    - Last, just run the buildGroovyDocs.xml as an ant script.  This can take
      several minutes to run.  If the Terminate process button is red then it
      is still running.

3.  Merge the results of the Groovydoc as described in the 
    r.s.relogo.runtime/docs/Readme.txt
