 INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING THE REPAST MODEL
 
The Repast Simphony model contained in this archive can be run by double clicking on the
included start_model.bat for Windows, or start_model.command for Linux or macOS. Depending 
on your Linux distribution and settings, double clicking start_model.command may be enough 
to run the model, otherwise run it from the terminal.
 
Please note that the model archive does not include a Java runtime, which must be available or be  
installed separately for the model to run.

After launching the Repast model with the appropriate run script described above, 
there may be a short delay before the Repast graphical user interface appears on the screen.   

The Repast model run controls are described in the online reference
manual here: https://repast.github.io/docs/RepastReference/RepastReference.html#_run_options .
